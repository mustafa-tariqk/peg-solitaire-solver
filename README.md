# peg-solitaire-solver
Me and a friend found this weird shape for a solitaire peg game, want to create a solver for it because we have not been able to solve it by hand.


It's a 5x5 board as follows:

```
  o o o
o o o o o
o o o o o
o o o o o
  o o o 
```


My solver wants to work on any n x m board with the same structure. No pegs or holes in the corners
